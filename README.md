## Description  
The Travel Journal is a personal web application designed to help users record and organize the places they have visited. Each destination entry includes details like the location, landmarks, time of year, and personal notes.
Users can add new destinations, view a full list, and click on any place to see more details.
This project was developed as part of a full-stack learning journey, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on object-oriented programming principles and test-driven development.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. Test: Create a Destination object with location, landmarks, time of year, and notes.
Expectation: A Destination instance should store all the provided properties correctly.

2. Test: Add a new destination to the DestinationLog.
Expectation: The DestinationLog should include the new destination in its record with a unique ID.

3. Test: Find a destion by its ID.
Expectation: When given a valid ID, the DestinationLog should return the correct Destination object.

4. Test: Try to find a destination with an invalid ID.
Expectation: If the ID does not exist, the method should return false.

5. Test: Delete a destination by its ID.
Expectation: If the ID exists, the destination should be removed from the log and return true.

6. Test: Try to delete a destination with an invalid ID.
Expectation: If the ID doesn't exist, the method should return false.
